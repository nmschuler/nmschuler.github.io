            <h1>Database</h1>
            <br />
            <p>All my classes regarding databases are summarized here to display my understanding. Included is my database design class, which is where we normalized databases, wrote basic queries, stored procedures, and triggers. As well as my database security class (which will be taken in the Spring 2017 semester. Will be added as soon as possible).</p>

            <h3>Normalization</h3>
               <p>We were given a database that was in 1NF, we were tasked to put it in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw3St7gyMUnZMzZQVUJJci1pb0E/preview" target="iframe_a" link="#top">2NF</a>, then take it from there into <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw3St7gyMUnZYTVNelpVcENucTQ/preview" target="iframe_a" link="#top">3NF</a>.
               </p>
            <h3>ERD</h3>
               <p>Part 1: Write the business rules for the given database.
                  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw3St7gyMUnZUlZtOVRwUDJNMUU/preview" target="iframe_a" link="#top">Business Rules</a>
               </p>
               <p>Part 2: Create a Crow's Foot ERD for the database in Visio. Each table must have at least 1 PK, any FKs, at least one non-key attribute.

               </p>
            <h3>SQL Code</h3>
               <p>We were given an access database we were meant to load into SQL Server. We then created the relationships as they were in the access database. We created a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw3St7gyMUnZdFRtYkJESGllY1E/preview" target="iframe_a" link="#top">diagram</a> in SQL Server that shows all the relationships. After we loaded the database into SQL Server, there were a handful of <a href="https://github.com/nmschuler/Portfolio/blob/master/DbDesign/A8.sql" target="_blank">queries</a> we ran on it that came from our textbook.
               </p>
               <br />
               <p>Using T-SQL, create tables then set primary keys and foreign keys to connect them together. We then loaded data into the tables from another file. After, we wrote <a href="https://github.com/nmschuler/Portfolio/blob/master/DbDesign/A11.sql" target="_blank">queries</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/nmschuler/Portfolio/blob/master/DbDesign/A11%20Procedures.sql" target="_blank">procedure</a> against the database. Most of the queries written were dealing with updates.
               </p>
            <h3>Joins</h3>
               <p>Part 1: We had to find the natural join of two tables that came from our textbook.</p>
               <p>Part 2: Add a row to the JOB table. Would the natural join be different with the addition of this new row? Explain.</p>
               <p>Part 3: Show the result of a left outer join and right outer join. Explain any difference you find.</p>

            <h3>Security</h3>
               <p>This section is blank right now. I will be taking database security (CIS 483) in the Spring 2017 semester. Once the class is finished, this page will be updated to display what I learned with database security.</p>
