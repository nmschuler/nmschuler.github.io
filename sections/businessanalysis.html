            <p>This section displays my ability in technical writing. Reading cases and writing up case reports along with suggestions for the company, creating use cases and designing a system around them, and even writing my own strategic assessment of a local non-profit company are all discussed in this section.</p>

            <h3>Hope Scarves Strategic Assessment</h3>
               <p>For my capstone course at the University of Louisville, we had to do a strategic assessment of a business. I chose to do it on a local non-profit organiztion called Hope Scarves. The assignment was to communicate with the leaders of the company and assess their current situation, where they need some improvement, what sort of technologies could they benefit from, then provide a few recommendations.</p>
               <p>At the time of writing, the strategic assessment is near completion. Once the assessment is completed and I have received permission to load it onto this portfolio, I will do so.</p>
            <h3>Case Reports</h3>
               <p>For my capstone course, we also had to write multiple case reports. We were assigned a few cases to read and analyze them and make our recommendations on what the company should do to fix the issues presented in the case. Below are a list of all the case reports I have written.</p>

            <h3>Systems Analysis and Design Report</h3>
               <p>Just like I wrote the strategic assessment (above), someone else wrote one for the KSOA (Kentuckiana Soccer Officials Association). That report was handed down to another class who would do the system analysis and design (this document presented here), and will then be actually developed. This document is the entire document that was worked on by the entire group.</p>

            <h3>Narratives, Risk Analysis, ERD & UI</h3>
               <p>The report that is posted above has a lot of this information in it, but these are some of the important documents that will be used for the design of the new system for the Kentuckiana Soccer Officials Association.</p>

            <h3>System Design Proposal</h3>
               <p>After my systems analysis and design class, we went to create their solution (which was a new website). The following document was the proposal my team and I put together to layout expectations. We said when each tasks will be complete in each iteration.</p>
