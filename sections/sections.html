            <p>This page is where I give examples of some of my skills. On the left sidebar, there is a list of different skill sets. For example, in the Database section, it contains examples of my works as well as homework assignments I have done while at the University of Louisville. From classes that are all about databases, or from a different class that we had to use a database.</p>
