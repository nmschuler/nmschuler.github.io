            <h1>Development</h1>
            <br />
            <p>This page is to demonstrate my competence with coding. Here I will show code from both of my software development classes (C#), web development, as well as our development project. The development project we did was a group project where we built a website for a non-profit organization.</p>
            <p>Most of the links to show the actual code will open a new tab to my GitHub page that has the appropriate code.</p>

            <h3>Basic Math</h3>
               <p>For my very first C# programming assignment (first time ever writing in C#), we were tasked with writing an application that calculates the cost of painting their home. The user inputs how many square feet need to be covered, and the calculator will return the price of the job (labor and cost of paint).</p>

            <br />
            <h3>Logic</h3>
               <p>Another assignment was to create an application to display when a student can register for a class. At the University of Louisville, if every student can register for classes all at once, the servers would crash. In order to make it a smoother process, the university splits up the registration window depending on your year and last name. Seniors register first, then the Juniors, and so on. Every seemster the last name changes around though. One semester, a student with the first letter of their last name being 'S' can register from 8am-10am, whereas the next semester they will register between 2pm-4pm. This application has a person click their year as well as type in their last name and the output is the registration window.</p>
               <p>There are two versions of the application. The first one is using a bunch of if-else statements, and the second application is cleaner, using arrays.</p>

            <h3>Library Application</h3>
               <p>For the entire semester of Software Development 2, we were working on creating a large application. We had multiple iterations of the assignment, leading up to a fully functional application.</p>
               <p>The goal of the application was to make a library. The user can input new books, CD's, DVD's, Blu-Ray's, etc. into the system. The user can then save it and all changes will be saved to a file. When opening the application again, the user can go to File > Open then browse the computer for the save file. The user can also search for items in the library and check them in or check them out.</p>

            <h3>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery</h3>
               <p>The first part of the web development class was learning HTML, JavaScript, and jQuery. Before this class I had no experience at all with any of this. The files I have from learning it were basic codes like how to change background color and font sizes. The best code example I can show you is the source code for this website. I wrote the website from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. I pulled in Bootstrap to help with the CSS as well as jQuery.</p>

            <h3>MVC</h3>
               <p>I used MVC to create a petstore. There is a page where the user of the website can check inventory for specific animals and breeds. When an administrator logs in, they are able to perform the CRUD operations. I also linked the Github repository to Azure in order to allow for continuous integration, but I no longer have an Azure subscription.</p>

            <br />
            <h3>Angular.js</h3>
               <p>One of our assignments was to follow along with a tutorial on <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js" target="_blank">CodeSchool.com</a> where we created a gem-store using angular.</p>

            <br />
            <h3>Development Project</h3>
            <p>As the following step from the my Systems Analysis and Design class, we actually went out and created the website for our client (this is continued from <a href="businessanalysis.html" target="_blank">here</a>). Inside this website support document include all the screen shots from the website my group and I created. We used WordPress for the website creation, since it will be easier for the client to maintain it (they could not afford a Webmaster to do website upkeep). Also included in the document is a list of all the plug-in's used and their versions and quick description of what it is used for.</p>
