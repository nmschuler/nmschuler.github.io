            <h1>Security</h1>
            <br />
            <p>In this section, I will show some work that I have done to demonstrate my understanding of information security. Most of my experience in this field comes from homework assignments. Most of the assignments were done in a virtual lab, so a lot of the examples are given in as screen shots or lab reports.</p>

            <h3>Reconnaissance</h3>
               <p>In a virtual environment, we used <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw3St7gyMUnZMUZHMTk3UEwwMGs/preview" target="iframe_a" link="#top">Wireshark</a> to capture and analyze network traffic. We reviewed collected data using NetWitness Investigator. We also used FileZilla to transfer files between two machines.</p>

            <br />
            <h3>NMAP</h3>
               <p>We did a vulnerability scan on a virtual network to identify <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw3St7gyMUnZZVZWUWZReTAwajg/preview" target="iframe_a" link="#top">devices</a> on the network and operating systems and services running on them. We also did a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw3St7gyMUnZcVc0M1F5WHU1MHc/preview" target="iframe_a" link="#top">port scan</a> to identify open ports on the network.</p>

            <br />
            <h3>Website and Database Attacks</h3>
               <p>At the time of this lab, we knew how to find vulnerabilities. This lab, we used cross-site scripting and SQL injection.</p>

            <br />
            <h3>Encryption</h3>
               <p>In one of the classes, we used the tool Kleopatra to generate public and private keys. We wrote a simple text file and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw3St7gyMUnZMm9yS2pRTkpscEk/preview" target="iframe_a" link="#top">encrypted</a> it. Send it to another machine, and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw3St7gyMUnZUDQwUWRMc2phQ00/preview" target="iframe_a" link="#top">decrypted</a> it.</p>

               <p>In the Network Security class, one of our labs was to take an encrypted message and decrypt it. We used a tool called Crypto. It was a trial and error class where we had to say what type of encryption was used and some key. They were kind of simple, but some kind of hard.</p>

            <br />
            <h3>Wireshark</h3>
               <p>For one of the labs in my Network Security class, we were given a Wireshark .pcap file to use. We used various filters, checked for three-way handshaking, and checking the packets sent (for MAC address, IP address, etc.).</p>

               <p>We did a packet analysis lab where we used a few tools on a virtual machine to extract a username and password, as well as read a file sent over the internet.</p>
