         <p>This website is to serve the purpose of showing off my knowledge on certain concepts. In order to suppliment my resume, this website will have actual code I have written and assignments that I have done while at the University of Louisville. Instead of showing you a screen shot of one code sample, I put my code on Github which will allow you to view the entirety of the file.</p>
         <p>On the navbar at the top, there is a "Sections" tab, which will have all work I have done broken up into specific areas. For example, there is a development section where I put all work I have done that relates to writing code. Some of the links take you to Github, others will open a document/picture in an iframe on the page.</p>
         <p>You can view my resume <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw3St7gyMUnZeW03TkhMYXA4RVU/view" target="_blank">here</a> and download it if you wish. In the top right corner of the website is my name, which when you click it, has a drop down list of ways to contact me.</p>
         <p>Thank you for taking the time to review my portfolio!</p>
