            <p>This website is to serve the purpose of showing off my knowledge on certain concepts. In order to suppliment my resume, this website will have actual code I have written and assignments that I have done while at the University of Louisville. Instead of showing you a screen shot of one code sample, I put my code on Github which will allow you to view the entirety of the file.</p>
            <p>On the navbar at the top, there is a "Sections" tab, which will have all work I have done broken up into specific areas. For example, there is a development section where I put all work I have done that relates to writing code. Some of the links take you to Github, others will open a document/picture in an iframe on the page.</p>
            <p>This website is mobile friendly. It was created for desktop use, but I also gave it mobile compatibility. You never know.</p>
            <p>Also on the navbar is my name. When clicked, a dropdown menu displays different ways of contacting me. These same ways are located on the right of this page.</p>

         <br />
         <div class="center">
            <p>First off, I want to thank you for taking the time out of your day to view my portfolio. My name is Nick Schuler, and I am from Louisville, Kentucky. I am almost finished with my college education with the plan of graduating May 2017. My major will be a BSBA in Computer Information Systems (CIS) with a focus in Information Security and Web Development.</p>
            <p>My resume has most of my professional information, so I am going to use this paragraph to talk about me as a person. By knowing me and my personality a little more, you will be able to see if I would fit in to the company's culture and be a good fit for each other.</p>
            <p>One question I am asked a lot is how I spend my time outside work. Since 2011, most of my life involves school and work. Through most of my college life, I also was working. So the time I wasn't in class or at work, I used that time for homework. In the small amount of free time I have, I like talking with friends, playing video games, and just researching anything interesting that pops in my head. After I graduate and my life starts to slow down a little for more free time, I would like to try hiking and being in nature.</p>
            <p>In 2017, I will be marrying the love of my life, Whitney. We met in high school, but didn't start dating until our senior year. Below is a picture of us during Christmas. I just came from ugly Christmas sweater day at Best Buy. I didn't own one, so I had to improvise.</p>
            <br />
            <center><img src="images/UglyChristmasSweater.png" alt="Ugly Christmas Sweater Pic" style="width:200px"></center>
            <br />
            <p>Lastly, I wanted to talk a little bit about my work history. In high school, I got my first job at Hobby Lobby which I worked during three summers. I played baseball for my high school as well, so I didn't have the time to juggle school, baseball, and work. When I came back from Morehead State University (2 semesters), I got a job at Best Buy and have been there since then. In May 2016, I got the internship at Humana. During the Fall 2016 and Spring 2017 semester, I went to school, Humana, and Best Buy. When I got the internship, I was told from friends I should leave Best Buy now that I have a job paying better. But I'm used to working a lot and I like being busy, so with the extra free time I wouldn't know what to do with myself.</p>
            <p>So that is a little about me. If you have any questions about anything on the portfolio, please don't hesitate to contact me.</p>
